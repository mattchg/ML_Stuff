# MachineLearningWorkThrough
Implemention of a neural network using TensorFlow to model the expected wins of a basketball team based on ~1000 seasons worth of statistics.

This is mostly an adaptation of the TensorFlow tutorial on Regression (they model MPG as a function of engine parameters) where a teams gross 
statistics are used to model their expected win total.

Initially I only used NBA teams, but in an effort to improve the accuracy of the model I expanded to college teams (and modified he stats to
reflect differences in NBA/College formats)

I think it could stand to be simplified (Overfitting could be an issue).
